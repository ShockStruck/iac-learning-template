## üîß Advanced Task Patterns

### Task Dependencies and DAGs

```yaml
tasks:
  # Parallel execution
  build-all:
    deps:
      - build:frontend
      - build:backend
      # Both run in parallel
      
  # Sequential execution
  deploy:
    cmds:
      - task: validate
      - task: build
      - task: push
      # Run one after another
      
  # Mixed patterns
  release:
    deps: [test, lint]  # Parallel
    cmds:
      - task: build     # Then sequential
      - task: deploy
```

### Dynamic Task Generation

```yaml
tasks:
  # For each service
  build-services:
    vars:
      SERVICES:
        sh: ls services/
    cmds:
      - for:
          var: SERVICES
        cmd: docker build -t {{.ITEM}} services/{{.ITEM}}
```

### Conditional Execution

```yaml
tasks:
  deploy:
    # Only run if tests pass
    preconditions:
      - sh: task test
        msg: "Tests must pass before deployment"
        
    # Skip if already deployed
    status:
      - test -f .deployed
      
    cmds:
      - docker compose up -d
      - touch .deployed
```

## üîÑ CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml
name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Install Task
        uses: arduino/setup-task@v1
        
      - name: Run tests
        run: task ci:test
        
      - name: Build
        run: task ci:build
        
      - name: Deploy
        if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        run: task ci:deploy
        env:
          SOPS_AGE_KEY: ${{ secrets.AGE_KEY }}
```

### Taskfile for CI

```yaml
# Taskfile.yml
tasks:
  ci:test:
    desc: "Run tests in CI environment"
    cmds:
      - docker compose -f docker-compose.test.yml up --abort-on-container-exit
      
  ci:build:
    desc: "Build for production"
    cmds:
      - docker compose build --pull
      
  ci:deploy:
    desc: "Deploy to production"
    preconditions:
      - sh: test -n "$SOPS_AGE_KEY"
        msg: "SOPS_AGE_KEY must be set"
    cmds:
      - task: sops:decrypt
      - task: compose:up:prod
```

## üöÄ Deployment Automation

### Zero-Downtime Deployment

```yaml
tasks:
  deploy:zero-downtime:
    desc: "Blue-Green deployment"
    cmds:
      # Start new version (green)
      - docker compose -f docker-compose.green.yml up -d
      
      # Health check
      - task: health:wait
        vars:
          SERVICE: green
          
      # Switch traffic
      - task: lb:switch
        vars:
          TO: green
          
      # Stop old version (blue)
      - docker compose -f docker-compose.blue.yml down
      
      # Rename for next deployment
      - mv docker-compose.green.yml docker-compose.blue.yml
```

### Rollback Procedure

      # Update compose file
      - task: compose:set-image
        vars:
          TAG: "{{.PREVIOUS_TAG}}"
          
      # Deploy old version
      - docker compose up -d
      
      # Verify health
      - task: health:check
```

```yaml
tasks:
  db:migrate:
    desc: "Run database migrations"
    preconditions:

    cmds:
      # Backup first
      - task: db:backup
      
      # Run migrations
      - docker compose exec postgres psql -U appuser -d appdb -f /migrations/{{.MIGRATION}}.sql
      
      # Verify
      - task: db:verify
